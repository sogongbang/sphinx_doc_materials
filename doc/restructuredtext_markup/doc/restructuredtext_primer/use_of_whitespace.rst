Use of whitespace
-----------------

All reST files use an indentation of 3 spaces; no tabs are allowed.  The
maximum line length is 80 characters for normal text, but tables, deeply
indented code samples and long links may extend beyond that.  Code example
bodies should use normal Python 4-space indentation.

Make use of multiple blank lines where applicable to clarify the structure of
the reST file.  Extra blank lines help group sections together to make the
organization of the file clearer.

A sentence-ending period may be followed by one or two spaces. While reST
ignores the second space, it is customarily put in by some users, for example
to aid Emacs' auto-fill mode.
