Results
=======

This section comprises the body of the thesis. 
The Results section should be presented in an explicit, logical order, so that the reader will understand the purpose of each experiment. 
This section summarizes the data obtained from the experiments and should describe the results in a matter-of-fact manner but not overly interpret them (which will be done in the Discussion). 
Rather than simply listing one experiment monotonously after another, walk us through your logic using key transition sentences that remind us of your underlying scientific questions. 
For example, instead of saying “Next, we used antibodies against Protein X at three different time points”, you might say “Next, in order to determine whether autism-associated proteins are indeed localized in the striatum throughout development, we used antibodies against Protein X at various postnatal ages.” 
If you completed two unrelated projects, you may consider separate sections or chapters within the Results section. You may also include relevant experiments with negative or no results.
