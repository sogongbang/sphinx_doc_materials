Materials and Methods
=====================

This section details how you conducted the experiments. 
Give enough detail so that the reader would be able to conduct a similar experiment to reproduce similar results (e.g., include all concentrations, final dilution amounts, incubation times, etc.), but don’t include the excruciating details of
full step-by-step protocols (if desired and relevant, these can be placed in an Appendix). 
Use subheadings to help guide the reader through the Material and Methods section (e.g., “Tissue preparation”; “Imaging
& Analysis”; etc.).
