Discussion
==========

The discussion section should first of all summarize and analyze the results that you have presented. 
For example: “We demonstrated in Figure 8 that cell proliferation was decreased in the presence of ATP receptor antagonists. 
This result could be interpreted in a number of ways…” then go on to explain that one likely interpretation would support your overall hypothesis, but a caveat might be that the pharmacological agents could have caused cell damage. 
(Ideally you have done a control experiment to rule that out – explain how that control supports your hypothesis here.) 
In addition to this type of discussion, recapitulate your overall argument(s) presented in the Introduction as well as strengths and weaknesses and address the theoretical issues that were used in approaching and analyzing the problem.
You should also explain how you may have modified your view of the issues in the course of conducting the analysis. 
If your experiments did not produce significant or meaningful results, explain here your thoughts on why this might have occurred, and suggest how things could be done differently. 
Convince the reader that you have fully thought through and understand the implications of your work, no matter how individual experiments may have turned out. 
The discussion is an important aspect of your thesis and should place your findings into the larger perspective. 
It is the best section to demonstrate to the reader how carefully you have thought about your work and how sophisticated your thinking might be regarding its nuances and implications. 
Be sure to compare your findings to previously published results – are your data consistent with findings from other studies? 
Why or why not? Importantly, end with a section detailing further questions to be asked and directions for future study. 
Faculty readers will look specifically for a discussion of how future experiments may build upon or improve your work. 
If this is missing, they may feel that you have not adequately thought things through.
