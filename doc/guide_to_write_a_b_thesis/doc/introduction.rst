Introduction
============

The Introduction should present an overall framework for your research by reviewing the literature, discussing what is currently known about the particular subject (as well as perhaps how this knowledge may have evolved historically), identifying relevant questions or debates that exist in the field, and detailing the specific questions that you investigate in the thesis. 
The Introduction often reads like a mini review article on your topic. 
It should be very obvious to the reader what specific scientific questions you aim to address with your work. 
If you introduce the background well, the reader should also understand why your specific experiments are an important and obvious next step for your particular field or laboratory.

You should end your introduction by clearly stating (or perhaps restating) your objectives and rationale for the thesis. This provides a starting point for the thesis and tells the reader what to expect in the forthcoming sections. 
For example, your Introduction may end with something like the following: “This thesis investigates the role of calcium waves in the development of the embryonic mammalian cortex.
Specifically, we will 1) use calcium imaging techniques to characterize the morphology and frequency of calcium waves that occur spontaneously in embryonic cortical slice preparations; 2) demonstrate electrophysiologically that calcium waves can be recapitulated with extracellular stimulation; 3) demonstrate pharmacologically that calcium waves are dependent upon ATP receptors; and 4) use a cell proliferation assay in embryonic brain slices to demonstrate that calcium waves are crucial to embryonic neurogenesis.” 
Try your best to list these items in a logical order that walks the reader through your ‘story’. Also include here any significant components of your work that it might be important to highlight, for example if your research involves a detailed statistical analysis.

Throughout the introduction you should supply sufficient information to allow the reader to understand the forthcoming results without their needing to read previous publications. 
Assume that your audience has the background of a general undergraduate engineer but not necessarily one that knows your field well. (I.e., this means that you don’t have to describe what MATLAB is, but you should explain things like “IHC”, “iPS cells”, or “MEMs”.) 
When in doubt, explain briefly. 
Include schematic figures or diagrams in your Introduction that illustrate the details you are introducing, e.g., important cell types/electrical system/prior art you are discussing or a complex biochemical pathway/system diagram. 
If it is something crucial for the reader to understand, a figure is always a good idea. It improves your overall presentation and also helps the reader to focus on the important points they must understand for the remainder of the thesis. Many authors feel that one figure should be included for every main point in a scientific paper.

Throughout the Introduction and all subsequent sections, you should include in-text citations of all relevant published work. 
References serve multiple purposes. 
Beyond their most important role in giving credit to previous work, references also serve as resources for the reader to learn where they might find further reading on a particular subject. 
Be sure to include relevant reviews or even textbook chapters that you found helpful as you learned about your topic. (See “References” section below for citation format.)
